# dotfiles
My Dotfiles for OSX in case anyone is wondering ...

## Installation

1. Install bash completion `brew install git bash-completion`
2. Change terminal profile to "PRO" set it to default
3. Clone the project in root, this is how you bypass it:
  ```
  cd ~/
  git init .
  git remote add origin https://github.com/mohamedmansour/dotfiles.git 
  git pull origin master
  ```
4. Restart terminal. Or source bash_profile
